- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paragdhumal
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working as a Cloud and DevOps Engineer in the IT Industry.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux, Cloud and DevOps technologies. I have a repository named Linux-AWS-DevOps which has basic things you need to learn these technologies. I also have another repository named MyProjects which has the documentation for all the projects that I have performed.
